Split with Willow!!

Honored the hunger since we won’t be home for awhile. getting a pretzel was hard; the only other “diet” option would’ve been a corn dog since at least it had protein, but I got the pretzel since I knew Willow was hungry and I thought a corn dog split between us wouldn’t be enough to run errands.
